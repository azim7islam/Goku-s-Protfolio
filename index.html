            <h3>She Cant Communicate With Others</h3>
            <p>It's Shouko Komi's first day at the prestigious Itan Private High School, and she has already risen to
                the
                status of the school's Madonna. With long black hair and a tall, graceful appearance, she captures the
                attention of anyone who comes across her. There's just one problem thoughâ€”despite her popularity, Shouko
                is
                terrible at communicating with others. Hitohito Tadano is your average high school boy.</p>

            <h2>Become A Social Person</h2>
            <p>Studies have shown that smiling releases endorphins, other natural painkillers, and serotonin. 9
                Together, these brain chemicals make us feel good from head to toe. Not only do they elevate your mood,
                but they also relax your body and reduce physical pain. Smiling is a natural drug</p>
