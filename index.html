            <h3>She Cant Communicate With Others</h3>
            <p>It's Shouko Komi's first day at the prestigious Itan Private High School, and she has already risen to
                the
                status of the school's Madonna. With long black hair and a tall, graceful appearance, she captures the
                attention of anyone who comes across her. There's just one problem though—despite her popularity, Shouko
                is
                terrible at communicating with others. Hitohito Tadano is your average high school boy.</p>

            <p>Studies have shown that smiling releases endorphins, other natural painkillers, and serotonin. 9
                Together, these brain chemicals make us feel good from head to toe. Not only do they elevate your mood,
                but they also relax your body and reduce physical pain. Smiling is a natural drug</p>

                        They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website
                        and
                        showed
                        it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
